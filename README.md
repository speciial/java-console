# The hsOS Application

## Description

The hsOS Application is a java project for learning the basics of algorithms and data structures.

## System Architecture

For people who want to extend the functionality of the project beyond what is asked during the course this is a
write-up on the general design of the system. It should help you find your way around the project and give you an idea
as to why certain things are the way they are.

### UI

The UI module provides a simple API to bring text and graphics to the screen. Since the primary task for this project
is to display a terminal, most of the API is geared towards exactly that.
